# Eviden Petshop

Eviden as a business has decided to enter the pet shop market. Being a
digital-first company, they have decided to build a webshop before opening a
physical store. They have hired you to build the webshop for them.

## The goal
Today you're pairing with someone with someone else to build features for the
webshop. The goal isn't to finish all of the features listed below, but to

questions, outline trade-offs.

## User stories

  which one to buy.

- As a user, I want to see more details about a pet, so that I can decide to
  purchase it.

- As an employee, I want to be able to add new pets to the shop, so that users
  can buy them.

- As an employee, I want to be able to update pets in the shop, so that I can
  change their details and status.
